# README #

+ These files will only have any value with [AMUMSS](https://www.nexusmods.com/nomanssky/mods/957)
+ I should probably use a markdown editor rather than doing this by _hand_ in the bitbucket text editor
+ Once you read the AMUMSS documentation thes files are fairly self explanatory.  Some are for use by themselves and others are meant to be used together and/or with existing mods to make patches.
